# My Personal Project

## *Stock Investment Tool*
This application will be a tool that allows the user to 
keep track of their current and potential/future stock 
investments. Users will be able to have important information 
about multiple stocks gathered in the same place. This application
is useful for anyone interested in investing in stocks. 

This project is of particular interest to me because I'm 
personally interested in investing in the stock market,
and would find it very helpful to have an application like this.
